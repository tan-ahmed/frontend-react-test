# hedgehog-lab-react test

### Live URL
- https://tranquil-strudel-479e4e.netlify.app/

### Frontend
-   React & TypeScript
-   ReactQuery for fetching & caching
-   Zustand for client state
-   Tailwind for styling
-   ESLint with AirBnb rules for code quality
-   Prettier for code formatting
-   react-hook-form with ZOD for form handling

### Setup for local
-   Create .env file with this (or copy contents from .env.sample)
-   `VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3002"`

### Run locally
`cd frontend`
`yarn install`
`yarn dev`

### Linting
if you do `yarn lint` there are no linting errors. I use EsLint AirBnb rules.

### Tests
I have commercial experience writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. But due to lack of time & juggling multiple interviews, I just didn't have the time to write any for this project.
